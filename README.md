# MBI buildit - learning - thoughts

Ok.  This is a pre-blog blog.

Where I dump my buildit-ideas, coding learnings, and thoughts on stuff.

Once it's been processed and cleaned, it can go to my cbira353.github.io portfolio site.

There may be replications between the two, but I'll try to avoid them.

### ARTICLES: My HOW-TO Guides
Whenever I learn something new, it's better to record the education for posterity. Mine. I'll soon forget what I did and why. So this category:Articles is where I will dump these HowTo's.


### BLOG: Rantings
Self explanatory

### BUILDIT: Ideas on What to Build and Why
My crazy ideas for revenue generating ideas will be here. Lots of things to get going on. SaaS subscription ideas, Data set creation ideas, whatever. If it is something that can be built with software (or software and hardware), I'll likely first put it here to stew.

`code here`

Fin.
