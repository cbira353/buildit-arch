## Scarfing a Speaker's Background Page
Many events have a speakers background files to give attendees an idea of the speaker's bacground.  This information can be more useful than a linkedin page. It can also be useful if you can capture the event (title, date, context, venue, tags) information to add context to the connection.

## How it should work
-Each Speaker background page should be downloaded
-Each Picture of the speaker should be downloaded
    - tagged with the name (eg, john-smith-01)
    - added to some container with other images
-Ideally, pull a linked-in link of the person
- Note - a way to place a short text note why this person has been scarfed.  
- Add some tags
