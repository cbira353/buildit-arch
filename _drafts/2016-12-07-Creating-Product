## Learning by Building Out Loud
The example of two authors who created similar design books. One, Nathan Barry, created his product 'out loud'. That is, as he learned something, he shared his education with the world, and especially with a community that formed around his learning journey.  Along the way, as he learned, he also taught what he had learned. The other author kept things to himself. 

When it came time to launch, Barry had a few hundred people primed to buy his book, and he sold $24,000 worth of product in 24 hours.

He reached that figure by learning out loud, teaching what he was doing, then launching his book.  Instead of coming out with an idea and trying to find customers for the idea, find a way to find a group of people who are eagerly waiting for you to release something.  Find the customers then give them the product they saw being made before their eyes.

## Building email lists
When Apple releases a  product and people line up outside stores eager to pay for it, that's what an email list is for.  

> Build a list then create a product that serves that list in an incredibly repatable, reliable and almost completely risk-free way to build a business that works nearly every time if done right.

### Three Phases to email list building
There are three phases to list building. First, grow the audience, the email list, and get it to at least 1,000 subscribers. Second, create the product that serves that list. Not just creating it, but using that list to find out what to create, validating that they want the product, and building it.  Third, is launching to the list.

How to grow? Blogging in Medium give you a algorithimically delivered list of readers. First, seed your list with every man, woman and child you have in your virtual rolodex: LinkeIn, Facebook, Twitter, Medium connections. Some of them might not find your content relevant, but they may think of two or three other people who might be interested. Also, go to your "Sent To:" email list and tell all of them them as well. In all social media, also send the announcement to the lists you follow. Second, participate in forums - offer help, comment, participate.  Send these people to a Coming Soon! page that you create. Remember Kevin Kelly's 1,000 true fans.

Depending on the 'How?' the list was put together, you may need a smaller list (because your content is already specific) and still get a large conversion of purchasers. 

### Validating your assumptions 
You need a large email list because the next step is to validate that what you are building is good enough and specifict enouth and is what your list actually wants. The list is the vehicle by which you would be able to ask your audience questions and really determine what that product is going to be at a certain point. 

At the start, the first 100 subscribers, it is important to keep sight of why you are doing this: Not asking people to do something, but you are inviting them to learn, to hear what you have to say. That you are being of service.
